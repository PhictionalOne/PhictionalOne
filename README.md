# Â¡Hola juntos!

Hi, I am Alexander or Phi for short.

As a student of computer science I often write code that in some form or another ends up on this plattform. 

And a lot on what I work already is here. Being an active part of [@fsi-tue](https://github.com/fsi-tue/) - a student union - makes it also possible for me to pile up on commits and PRs.
